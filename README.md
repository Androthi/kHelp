# kHelp

This is the document viewer for the various .khelp extended help files that come with the projects on this site.
The binaries are included in the bin folder of the HIDE package used to compile this and other HLA projects.

kHelp uses a simplified ini ascii file as the basis for the document format.

The HIDE project file is setup to output kHelp.exe directly into the HIDE\bin folder.
